## Braitenberg Vehicle Simulation
This project aims to simulate Braitenberg vehicles, inspired by the pioneering work of the Italian-Austrian cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg. Braitenberg vehicles are simple vehicles equipped with sensors and actuators, capable of exhibiting complex behaviors through simple sensor-motor connections.

## Features
- Braitenberg Vehicle Models: Implementations of various Braitenberg vehicle models, including those with different sensor configurations and behavioral patterns.

- Realistic Simulation: Utilizing Unreal Engine's powerful physics engine to provide a realistic environment for simulating Braitenberg vehicle behaviors.

- Customizable Parameters: Users can tweak parameters such as sensor sensitivity, motor speed, and vehicle morphology to observe different emergent behaviors.

- Visualization Tools: Tools for visualizing sensor inputs, motor outputs, and overall vehicle behavior, aiding in understanding the inner workings of the simulated vehicles.

- Educational Resources: Documentation and tutorials explaining the principles behind Braitenberg vehicles and how to use the simulation for educational purposes.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Open the project in Unreal Engine.

- Explore different Braitenberg vehicle models by adjusting parameters and observing their behavior in the simulated environment.

- Refer to the documentation and tutorials for a deeper understanding of Braitenberg vehicles and how to utilize the simulation for educational purposes.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's bug fixes, feature enhancements, or additional educational resources, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Credits
This project was completed as a semester project for Professor Dr. Douglas W. Cunningham's course 13869 | Braitenberg Vehikel Praktikum | WiSe 23/24 at Brandenburg University of Technology. It is maintained by Hamza Danish. It was inspired by the groundbreaking work of Valentino Braitenberg and is made possible by the Unreal Engine community and open-source contributors.

## Acknowledgements
